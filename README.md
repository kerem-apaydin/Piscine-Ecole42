  # **42 School Exercises**

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to various exercises from the 42 School curriculum.
It includes the Shell modules, foundational C practice, algorithmic challenges, memory management tasks, and small low-level implementations.
The repo documents my progress throughout the Piscine/Core curriculum while keeping everything neatly organized.

## What’s Inside

* **Shell Fundamentals:** Basic command usage, permissions, scripting
* **C Fundamentals:** Strings, pointers, arrays, memory handling
* **Algorithmic Exercises:** Sorting logic, recursion, backtracking
* **Low-level Implementations:** Custom library functions, manual parsing, input validation
* **Norm-Compliant Code:** Written according to the 42 Norm
* **Clear Progression:** Exercises get gradually more complex across modules

## Repository Structure

* `C00` → Simple output and syntax basics
* `C01` → Pointers, arrays, parameter manipulation
* `C02` → String manipulation
* `C03` → String comparison and operations
* `C04` → Parsing, string-to-number conversion
* `C05` → Recursion exercises
* `C06` → Program arguments and CLI handling
* `C07` → Memory allocation

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kerem-apaydin/Piscine-Ecole42.git
cd 42-exercises
```

Compile any C file manually:

```bash
cc file.c -Wall -Wextra -Werror
```

## Objective

This repository exists to:

* Track my 42 School learning path
* Practice clean, efficient C and shell usage
* Build a foundation for bigger Core projects
